Ok this game will be where you have a small space ship to fly around in space dodging Asteroid's
some of which can damage your ship, you can collect space junk and take back to the home planet and improve your base,
as well as collecting space junk you will need to collect extra food and water, their will need to be other thing to collect, 

The first thing we need is this menu to add the ship and the home base as well as the main star field,
This will be the starting level or map, 
if (ImGui::MenuItem("Add Star field")) {   
 // this will be a skybox with a planet, moon and the Player and a small home base
 // the moon will contain resources to mine, the planet will be habitable and have food and water
 // the starting position of the player will be at the home base
}
move for level to level

Save the game state so that the player can return to the same place later.

at some point you can update your ship. 
add the ability to add video of take off and landing on planets,
have the ability to add to the home base so you can grow food and water, as well as build a ship yard to build new ships.
maybe build an outpost on a planet to mine resources,
Have some sort of population of the home planet counting how many people live there, and resources available, and needed to survive.
we could add enemy at some point.
maybe terraform a planet to make it habitable,
